description: >-
  Read-only review of pull requests, branches, and diffs. Use when asked to
  review a PR, branch, or diff, assess a change, or review a PR number or
  GitHub PR URL. Return prioritized findings without applying patches.
---

Find defects and unnecessary complexity the author can act on. Favor simple data representations, explicit control flow, clear ownership, and local reasoning. Challenge abstractions, layers, and dependencies without a present need. Understand the constraints before recommending deletion; fewer lines alone are not evidence.

## Boundaries

- Do not edit files, apply or emit patches, change the checkout/index, install dependencies, or publish a review.
- Read with shell, git, and gh; fetching needed refs/objects is allowed. Before running existing tests/checks, inspect their scripts/configuration. Disposable outputs are fine; rewriting source, lockfiles, or snapshots and mutating shared services are not. Attribute results only to the code actually tested.

## Establish the comparison

- Resolve repository, head commit, and base. Use `gh pr view` for the PR description/base/head and `gh pr diff` for the change. For a branch, use the stated base or its PR base; otherwise use the repository default and state the assumption. Ask when evidence leaves competing bases, such as stacked branches. Never assume the checkout is the PR.
- When commits are available, inspect `git diff <base>...<head>`. Read surrounding files at the reviewed revision with `git show <head>:<path>`; exclude unrelated local changes.

## Investigate before flagging

- Inventory the whole diff, then review in risk order. Trace changed behavior through callers, state changes, error paths, and tests. Check compatibility, migration/deployment ordering, and concurrency where affected.
- Compare the diff with the description. Flag undisclosed behavior changes when they alter a contract, compatibility, or rollout assumption; explain the consequence.
- Where input, auth, config, or secrets change, check for injection, missing authorization, exposed secrets, and unsafe deserialization.
- For a suspected defect, identify a supported input/state, the violated contract, and its consequence. Check the base; seek callers, guards, or tests that disprove it. Report issues introduced or exposed by the change. A clear code trace suffices; distinguish inference from reproduction.
- For complexity, name the present cost in understanding, debugging, or changing the code and a simpler direction that preserves its constraints. Unfamiliarity, personal taste, and hypothetical needs do not qualify.
- Check whether tests exercise changed behavior and failures. Flag missing coverage only for a specific nontrivial behavior left unprotected.
- Consolidate duplicate symptoms. Skip routine lint/format nits, praise, and speculation. Investigate consequential uncertainty or state it as a question. Do not pad or cap findings.

## Report

First line: `Reviewed <head> against <base>. Blockers: <x>. Should fix: <y>. Scope: <files/paths examined>.`

Enumerate findings by impact, with these fields:

1. [Blocker] src/billing/refund.py:42 — Refund can exceed the original charge.
   Scenario: a request amount greater than charge.amount passes validation.
   Evidence: validate_refund checks only amount > 0; both callers, refund_api.py and refund_cli.py, pass the amount through unchanged.
   Fix direction: enforce the charge bound in validate_refund.

Anchor to the smallest relevant changed range. Blocker means demonstrated serious harm or broken core behavior; Should fix means another concrete defect or justified simplification. Severity follows impact, not confidence. For complexity, Scenario names the present cost; give a fix direction only when supported.

If none qualify, say: "No actionable findings in the reviewed scope." Separately state checks run/results, consequential open questions, and material gaps, including unreviewed areas. Do not claim merge safety. If asked for a recommendation, qualify it by evidence and coverage.
